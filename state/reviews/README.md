## Report Types

Each review can include the following agent reports:

| Agent | Focus Area | Output File |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| **code-reviewer** | Code quality, correctness, maintainability | `{project}-code-reviewer.md` |
| **security-auditor** | Security vulnerabilities, auth/auth issues | `{project}-security-auditor.md` |
| **test-architect** | Test coverage, test quality, missing tests | `{project}-test-architect.md` |
| **docs-writer** | Documentation completeness, clarity | `{project}-docs-writer.md` |
| **refactorer** | Code smells, refactoring opportunities | `{project}-refactorer.md` |
| **debugger** | Known bugs, potential issues, error handling | `{project}-debugger.md` |

## Reading Reports

1. **Start with the SUMMARY**: `{project}-SUMMARY.md` provides an executive overview
2. **Check Critical Issues**: All 🔴 critical findings are consolidated in the summary
3. **Review Individual Reports**: Each agent report has detailed analysis and recommendations
4. **Track Remediation**: Use `my-context` to track fix progress

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Full review of my-grid (all agents)
./scripts/deep-review.sh my-grid

# Quick security and code quality check
./scripts/deep-review.sh tui-base --quick

# Specific agents only
./scripts/deep-review.sh ps-cli --agents code-reviewer,docs-writer

# Custom output location
./scripts/deep-review.sh my-grid --output-dir ./custom-reports
```

## Integration with Workflows

### After Development Sprint
```bash
# Review what changed
./scripts/deep-review.sh my-project
# Create issues for critical findings
gh issue create --repo jcaldwell-labs/my-project --body "$(cat state/reviews/YYYY-MM-DD/my-project-SUMMARY.md)"
```

### Before Release
```bash
# Full audit before tagging a release
./scripts/deep-review.sh my-project --all
# Address all critical findings
# Tag release only when clean
```

### Regular Health Checks
```bash
# Weekly automated review (add to cron)
./scripts/deep-review.sh --quick my-project
```

## Report Retention

- Keep recent reports (last 30 days) for reference
- Archive older reports if storage is a concern
- Summary reports should always be kept for historical tracking
