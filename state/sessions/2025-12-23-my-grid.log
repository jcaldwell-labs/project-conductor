## Summary

Successfully advanced the **my-grid** project with the following:

**Issue Addressed**: Fixed failing test related to Issue #59 (PTY Terminal Emulation)

**Problem**: The `test_backspace` test in `tests/test_pty_screen.py` had incorrect expectations about terminal backspace behavior. It expected `\b` to delete the character, but in real VT100/ANSI terminals, backspace only moves the cursor left - it doesn't erase the character.

**Fix**: Updated the test to:
1. Verify cursor position after backspace (correct behavior: cursor moves back)
2. Added test case for the proper terminal erase pattern (`\b ` - backspace + space to overwrite)
3. Added detailed docstring explaining the difference between cursor movement and deletion

**Commit**: `97eb9ca` - "fix: Correct PTY backspace test to match VT100 terminal behavior"

**Results**: 
- All 175 tests pass
- Branch is ahead of origin by 1 commit (ready for orchestrator to push)
