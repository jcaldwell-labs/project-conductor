# Session: 2025-12-31 Strategic Planning & cc-bash POC

## Summary

Year-end strategic planning session combined with cc-bash POC completion.

## Completed Work

### cc-bash POC (smartterm-prototype)
- Complete rewrite of cc-bash with three-region TUI layout
- Removed readline dependency, implemented custom input with termios raw mode
- ANSI scroll regions for output area
- Arrow key history navigation
- Terminal resize handling (SIGWINCH)
- Created PR #19: https://github.com/jcaldwell-labs/smartterm-prototype/pull/19
- Follow-up issues: #15 (tab completion), #16 (color pass-through), #17 (clear), #18 (scrollback)

### 2026 Strategic Vision
- Created `/docs/planning/jcaldwell-labs-2026-vision.md`
- Created `/docs/planning/2026-q1-action-plan.md`
- Key insight: "Making knowledge work visible and persistent in terminal environments"
- Identified synergies: my-context → my-grid → cc-bash integration path

### Organization Profile Update
- Updated github.com/jcaldwell-labs profile README
- Aligned with 2026 vision and core platform focus
- Commit: 0a260cf

## Strategic Priorities for 2026

1. Ship my-context to real users (10+ by Q2)
2. Consolidate terminal TUI into my-grid platform
3. Make meta-layer invisible (auto-trigger skills)
4. Build for "Sam the Senior Dev" persona
5. Archive projects not serving users (tario)

## Project Repositioning

- fintrack: Sample app demonstrating jcaldwell-labs patterns
- terminal-stars: Minimalist shader teaching tool
- tario: Archive candidate
- cc-bash: Future my-grid zone type

## Internal Tools Review

Also completed internal/private tooling assessment (stored in ~/work/docs/planning/).

## Next Review

2026-01-15 (two weeks)
