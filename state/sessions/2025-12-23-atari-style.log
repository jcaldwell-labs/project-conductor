I've successfully advanced the **atari-style** project. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

## Summary

### Phosphor Persistence Post-Processing Shader

**New Files Created:**
1. `atari_style/shaders/post/phosphor.frag` - GLSL fragment shader implementing phosphor decay
2. `atari_style/demos/visualizers/phosphor_demo.py` - Demo script showcasing the effect

**Modified Files:**
1. `atari_style/core/gl/pipeline.py` - Added PhosphorPreset and pipeline integration

### Features Implemented:

**Shader Capabilities:**
- Temporal feedback using ping-pong framebuffers for persistence
- Configurable persistence level (0.0 - 0.95)
- Glow intensity control
- Color bleed simulation (RGB decay at different rates, mimicking P22 phosphor)
- Burn-in effect for static elements
- Subtle per-pixel noise for organic feel
- Bloom effect on bright areas

**Pipeline Integration:**
- `PhosphorPreset` dataclass with 7 built-in presets:
  - `off`, `subtle`, `classic`, `heavy`, `arcade`, `green_terminal`, `motion_blur`
- `add_phosphor_pass()` method for easy pipeline setup
- `set_phosphor_preset()` for runtime preset switching
- `get_phosphor_preset_names()` helper function
- Proper resource management (resize/release) for ping-pong buffers

**Demo Script:**
- Renders phosphor effect with various base shaders (plasma, spiral, lissajous)
- Supports combining phosphor with CRT effects
- Video export (MP4/GIF) capability
- `--list-presets` option to show all available presets

### Test Results:
- All 583 existing tests pass
- Ruff linting passes
- Python syntax verified

### Commit:
```
feat: Add phosphor persistence post-processing shader
```

This advancement addresses the "Phosphor persistence" item from the roadmap's shader library expansion priorities.
