# atari-style Advancement Prompt

You are advancing atari-style - retro visual effects and shaders for terminal applications.

## Priority Focus Areas

1. **Shader Library Expansion**
   - CRT curvature effect
   - Phosphor persistence
   - RGB separation/chromatic aberration

2. **Integration Examples**
   - Demo with terminal-stars
   - Demo with boxes-live storyboards

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Frame rate consistency
   - Memory efficiency for large canvases

## Process

1. Check `.github/planning/ROADMAP.md` for current priorities
2. Review open issues for shader requests
3. Implement ONE new shader or improvement
4. Include demo script showing the effect
5. Commit with clear description

## Technical Notes

- Shaders are Python scripts in `shaders/`
- Use numpy for performance-critical operations
- Test with `python -m pytest` if tests exist
